### Hello there!

My name is Alberto Kummer, 30 years old, and Ph.D .in Computer Science at [Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul](https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/ppgc/). Since my undergraduate in 2014, I'd been working with optimization problems such as [vehicle scheduling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305054819301789), and [physician scheduling](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10479-020-03552-5). In my Ph.D., I study and propose algorithms for solving the so-called [Home Health Care Problem](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3377930.3390209). Most of my repositories contain experiments and data regarding my Ph.D. 

I am an open-source enthusiast, and I use Linux as my daily driver system. Previously, I used a macOS based system for development. Besides, I use mostly Windows for my gameplays, due to the pain of configuring a stable Linux setup with proprietary graphics support. As I usually say, we should use the right tool to solve a problem, not the one you're most used to. 

Please feel free to explore my open repositories and try some of my work. If you want ping me, please get in touch with at [alberto.kummer] at [gmail.com].
